## TickMan Trouble ticket manager

Welcome to the TickMan application. In the past I worked as a support engineer and worked with Remedy. It was a very elaborate tool but there were some features that I found very powerfull. Im the search of a open source tool I came out very dissapointed. No open source tool could do the things I thought needed to properly manage incidents. So now you know... Why I did it.
 
####Some key features:

- Create tickets (off course)
- Assign tickets to reps
- Keep track off the progress made in a tickets via logs
- Work your way through the tickets, event driven via trigger times
